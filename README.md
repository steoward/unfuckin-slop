# Unfuckin-Slop

Design knowledge that costs only what the moment needs.

Two of the best frontend design skills, **Apple Design** (Emil Kowalski, distilled from Apple's
WWDC interface talks) and **Impeccable** (Paul Bakaus, Apache-2.0), fused into **30 atom cards** and
served on demand by a **zero-dependency Rust binary** — plus an MCP server and a Playwright pairing
for real inspiration galleries.

The problem it solves is not knowledge. It is context. Loading both skills means ~10,000 tokens
before you write a line of CSS, and most of it is irrelevant to the one thing you are doing. Here the
always-on layer is ~1,600 tokens, and the router pulls one to four cards (usually ~1,700) that match
the task in front of you.

```
SKILL.md              always loaded, ~1.6k tok     the protocol + the non-negotiables + the index
     │
     ├─ unfslop context "draggable sheet that snaps" ranks 29 cards, prints 4 that fit 2k tok
     │      └─ cards/apple.springs.md               one idea, one page, only when asked for
     │
     └─ unfslop lint src/                           the mechanical half of the quality floor
```

## Quick start

```bash
cargo build --release          # builds unfslop & unfslop-mcp
target/release/unfslop doctor
target/release/unfslop context "settings page with destructive actions"
```

Put `unfslop` (or `unfslop.exe`) somewhere on `PATH`, or use the copy installed with the skill.

### Install as an agent skill

```bash
unfslop install                  # → .claude/skills/unfuckin-slop
unfslop install --user           # → ~/.claude/skills/unfuckin-slop
unfslop install --dir path/to/skills/unfuckin-slop
```

That writes `SKILL.md`, all 29 cards, `NOTICE.md`, and a copy of the binary at `bin/unfslop`, so the
skill keeps working on a machine with no Cargo toolchain. Any SKILL.md-compatible agent can use it
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and friends); point it at the folder.

For this repository itself, the skill is already in `skills/unfuckin-slop/`. Agents that scan
`.claude/skills` need the install step.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `unfslop context "<task>"` | The main command. Ranks cards, prints only those that fit the budget. |
| `--budget N` | Token ceiling for the pack. Default 2000. |
| `--limit N` | Card ceiling. Default 6. |
| `--mode M` | Force a mode: `build`, `motion`, `gesture`, `critique`, `polish`, `system`, `a11y`, `native`. |
| `--brief` | Headers and token costs only, no bodies. |
| `--all` | Ignore budget and limit (rarely what you want). |
| `unfslop get <id>` | One card, full text. |
| `unfslop search "<query>"` | BM25 over titles, triggers, ids and bodies. Scores shown. |
| `unfslop cards` | The index: id, token cost, title. No bodies. |
| `unfslop lint [paths]` | 18 deterministic anti-slop and craft checks. |
| `unfslop install` | Write the skill and binary to a skills directory. |
| `unfslop doctor` | Library size, thin-layer share, install state. |
| `unfslop stats` | Tokens by source, largest cards. |
| `--json` | Any read command emits structured output. |

## The cards

**Apple craft** — `response`, `direct-manipulation`, `interruptibility`, `springs`,
`velocity-projection`, `spatial`, `gestures`, `materials`, `typography`, `motion-a11y`,
`multimodal`, `principles`, `process`.

Numbers are preserved, not paraphrased away: damping 1.0 / response 0.4 for a move, 0.8 / 0.3 for a
sheet, the `0.998` momentum projection, the grab offset, the -0.04em tracking floor, the ~300ms tap
delay to delete.

**Direction and QA** — `workflow`, `modes`, `craft-floor`, `bans`, `slop-test`, `layout`, `typeset`,
`color`, `motion`, `states`, `copy`, `a11y`, `performance`, `critique`, `polish`, `system`.

The permanent ban (an eyebrow above a heading), the refused defaults (side stripes, gradient text,
hard shadows, nested cards, emoji as icons), the four modes, and the review format that refuses to
average the weakest axis away.

Each card carries front matter the router uses:

```
id: apple.interruptibility
title: Interruptibility — the single most important principle
triggers: interrupt, reverse, redirect, mid-flight, cancel, animation, ...
pulls: apple.springs, apple.velocity-projection
weight: 10
```

`always: true` marks the craft floor, which is placed second in every pack so it is read rather than
skipped.

## Lint

`unfslop lint src/` reports `path:line severity rule`, the problem, and the fix. Exit code 1 on error.

| Group | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `ban.*` | eyebrow/kicker, gradient text, side stripe >1px, hard offset shadow, zero-offset halo, `transition: all` |
| `type.*` | tracking below -0.04em, px root font size |
| `a11y.*` | missing alt, clickable div, removed outline, hover without focus-visible |
| `motion.*` | transform motion without reduced-motion, CSS-driven gesture motion |
| `perf.*` | animating layout properties |
| `copy.*` | em dash, "click here", lorem ipsum |

`--ignore ban` drops a whole group; `--ignore a11y.img-alt` drops one rule; `--fail-on warn` is
stricter, `--fail-on never` is for exploratory runs. Fix the cause, do not mute the rule.

A `.slopignore` in the working directory excludes unrelated paths (one prefix per line, `#` for
comments), so tool state and archives do not drown the findings.

`fixtures/` is a deliberate violation set: `unfslop lint fixtures` finds 19 findings (6 errors).

## Design notes

- **Zero dependencies, no async runtime.** The whole tool is ~2,000 lines of std Rust. Builds offline,
  starts in milliseconds, and has no supply chain to audit.
- **Embedded cards with a disk override.** `build.rs` bakes the cards into the binary so it works
  anywhere; if `UNFUCKIN_SLOP_HOME` or a `cards/` directory sits next to the binary or the cwd, that
  wins, so editing a card is a rebuild-free operation.
- **Budget is estimated, not tokenized.** Four characters per token keeps the tool instant and errs on
  the safe side. The pack never pads to fill the budget: if a mandated card does not fit, it stops.
- **Relevance is thresholded.** Extras must score at least 25% of the best match, so a big budget
  cannot smuggle in weak material.
- **The linter is the point of the second half.** A model will claim it checked contrast, states, and
  focus rings. It will not. These 18 checks are deterministic, cheap, and cite the rule they come
  from.

## Verify

```bash
cargo test                     # 24 unit + integration tests
cargo build --release          # builds unfslop, unfslop-mcp (and aliases)
target/release/unfslop context "spring sheet snap" --budget 1200
target/release/unfslop lint fixtures; echo "exit=$?"
```

## MCP and inspiration galleries

Unfuckin-Slop ships cooperating pieces:

1. **The skill** (`skills/unfuckin-slop` + 30 atom cards): design knowledge, rules, and smart router.
2. **`unfslop-mcp`**: an MCP server (stdio) exposing live scrapers and structured design tools:
   - `collectui_challenges`: Complete catalog of 50+ Daily UI challenges with exact paths.
   - `collectui_categories`: Hand-curated pattern map (modals, dashboards, checkouts, settings, etc.).
   - `collectui_fetch_shots`: Live HTTP scraper extracting curated shots and Dribbble links directly from CollectUI.
   - `collectui_auth_recipe`: Pro session authentication workflow for CollectUI/Dribbble.
   - `pixlpin_tags`: Full mobile & web pattern tags directory.
   - `pixlpin_fetch_screens`: Live HTTP scraper for Pixlpin flow screens.
   - `pixlpin_auth_recipe`: Pro session authentication workflow for Pixlpin.
   - `unfslop_pro_workflow`: Step-by-step master workflow for building world-class UI.
   - `search_cards`, `get_card`, `list_cards`, `pack`, `detect_mode`, and `lint`.
3. **Playwright MCP** (`@playwright/mcp`): the browser automation pairing for full interactive inspection when needed.

Wire both in your MCP client (see `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unfslop": { "command": "unfslop-mcp" },
    "playwright": { "command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"] }
  }
}
```

Workflow: `inspiration_sources` or `collectui_fetch_shots` fetches real curated shots → analyze spatial layout, hierarchy, and tokens → cross-check against `imp.craft-floor` and `imp.bans` → `unfslop lint` the final implementation.
